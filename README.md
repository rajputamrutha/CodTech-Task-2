OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Key Concepts in NLP:
Tokenization:

Definition: Breaking text into smaller units such as words or sentences.
Example: Splitting a sentence into individual words or extracting phrases.
Stopwords:

Definition: Commonly used words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") that are typically filtered out during text processing to focus on meaningful words.
Example: Removing stopwords before performing analysis or modeling.
Stemming and Lemmatization:

Stemming: Reducing words to their root or base form by removing affixes.
Lemmatization: Similar to stemming but ensures resulting words are actual dictionary words (lemmas).
Example: Converting "running", "ran", "runs" to "run".
Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:

Definition: Assigning grammatical tags (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.
Example: Tagging "cat" as a noun and "jumped" as a verb.
Named Entity Recognition (NER):

Definition: Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, locations, dates) in text.
Example: Recognizing "Apple" as a company name or "New York" as a location.
Syntax and Parsing:

Syntax: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences.
Parsing: Assigning syntactic structure to sentences based on grammar rules.
Example: Identifying subject, object, and verb relationships in a sentence.
Word Embeddings:

Definition: Mapping words or phrases from vocabulary to vectors of real numbers.
Example: Representing words with similar meanings closer together in vector space.
Language Modeling:

Definition: Predicting the probability of a sequence of words occurring in a sentence.
Example: Generating text or completing sentences based on learned patterns.
Sentiment Analysis:

Definition: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text (positive, negative, neutral).
Example: Analyzing product reviews to understand customer opinions.
Machine Translation:

Definition: Automatically translating text from one language to another.
Example: Converting English text to French text.
Question Answering:

Definition: Automatically answering questions posed in natural language.
Example: Responding to "Who is the president of the United States?" with "Joe Biden".
